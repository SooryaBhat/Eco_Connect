I want to build a complete web app using Flask (Python) for backend and HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap for frontend.
The database should be MySQL, connected using SQLAlchemy.

The app connects four roles: User, Collector, Recycler, and Government.
I will host the backend on Render, and the database will be in MySQL Workbench, which I will connect via SQLAlchemy.

Login Page

Fields: Username, Role (dropdown), Password

Below login, add text: “Don’t have an account? Sign up” (click → goes to signup page)

Signup Page

Fields: Username, Contact, Email, Role (dropdown), Location, Create Password, Confirm Password

After signup, redirect to login page.

Roles and Pages

Each role has its own homepage after login with a top “Welcome, {name}” box and a right-side menu bar (three-line icon).
The menu bar and bottom navigation buttons must match each role’s functions.

User Role:

Pages: Dashboard, Complaint, Sell

Dashboard: “Scan the Bin” button → opens camera to scan saved bin QR → shows:

Recyclable & Non-recyclable compartment weight

% filled

Last cleaned date

Status (Urgent, Medium, Enough space)

Complaint: user can submit complaints about bins.

Sell: shows nearby recyclers in their location and “Sell your waste” form (image upload, waste type, etc.)

On submit, waste is listed and visible to recyclers in that location.

Collector Role:

Pages: Dashboard, Sell, Complaint Received, Analytics

Dashboard: shows all bins’ statuses in their assigned location (Urgent / Medium / Enough Space).

Sell: same as user’s sell page.

Complaint Received: lists all complaints from users.

Analytics: later I will connect this to Power BI using the database; so make a placeholder “Analytics” page where charts/graphs can be embedded later.

Recycler Role:

Pages: Buy, Complaint, Sell

Buy: shows all listed sell waste in their area.

Sell: same form as others.

Complaint: simple page to send or view complaints.
(No analytics for recycler.)

Government Role:

Pages: Dashboard, Complaint Details, Buy & Sell Details, Analytics

Dashboard: shows bin status in all assigned locations.

Complaint Details: all complaints in that region.

Buy & Sell Details: list of who sold to whom, etc.

Analytics: placeholder page for Power BI integration later to view bin and waste analytics graphically.

Design Requirements

Use Bootstrap for layout and styling.

Use images/icons for visual appeal (like bin icons, graph icons, etc.).

Make it mobile responsive.

Use separate files for:

app.py (Flask backend)

templates/ (HTML pages)

static/css/ and static/js/ (for styles and scripts)

Keep routes modular and clearly named for each role.

Database tables: users, bins, complaints, waste_sales, etc.

Connect to MySQL via SQLAlchemy (I’ll add my connection string manually).
